This code reproduces the figures 3, and 5-11 in the manuscript _Active exterior cloaking for the 2D Helmholtz equation with complex wavenumbers and application to thermal cloaking_ by Maxence Cassier, Trent Degiovanni, Sébastien Guenneau and Fernando Guevara Vasquez.

## Instructions
The script `FigNNN.m` reproduces figure NNN in the paper. All figures except for Figures 10 and 11 can be generated in a few seconds. Figure 10 takes less than 24 hours to generate and Figure 11 more than 24 hours. 

The code is written in Matlab and was tested on Matlab 2018b. For reference, the benchmark values are `LU 0.1159 FFT 0.1266 ODE 0.0183 Sparse 0.0896 2-D 0.4366 3-D 0.4204`.
